  <i>A DreamBerd parser.</i>

  <h1>NOTES</h1>
</div>
<br>
This parser is based off of the DreamBerd concept, written by TodePond/Lu Wilson.
Remember, it is a concept and also that this isn't official (this is supported
by the fact that anything with the name "DreamBerd" in it doesn't belong to TodePond's
foundation) and therefore we've decided to change some features of the language up.
Hope you contributors and DreamBerd devs don't mind the differences! Also, this isn't
THE DreamBerd parser. This is just A dreamberd parser. There are people who could do
this way better, probably even TodePond themselves considering how many languages
they've made. Anyway, hope you enjoy this absolute mess!

  <h2>Printing</h2>
</div>
To print to the screen, use the <code>p</code> command (which stands for 'print') to print
to the screen. Here's an example, which you can also read in the <code>examples/</code>
folder:
<br><br>
<code class="example">
<b># this is a comment. and yes, everything needs to end with an exclamation mark lol # !</b>
<br>
p("Hello, DreamBerd!")!
</code>

  <h2>Comments</h2>
</div>
Defining comments is absolute hell in this, because the parser is written in python. To
define a function, start of the line with a <code>#</code> and write whatever you need to
write. Then write another <code>#</code> to declare the end of the comment and then the
<code>!</code> to declare the EOL. Here is an example, taken from the Hello, DreamBerd
example:
<br>
<code class="example">
  <b># this is a comment. and yes, everything needs to end with an exclamation mark lol # !</b>
</code>
